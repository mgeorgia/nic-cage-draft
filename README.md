Everyone picks their favorite Nic Cage movie.  Draft order is random (seeded for repeatability for those who wish to re-run the draft) but odds are influenced by the movie you choose.  Three factors influence the odds:
1) CAGE FACTOR of the chosen movie.  CAGE FACTOR is not something that can be contained by an ordinary definition, as it cannot be written in words without a portal to hell opening. however, some examples of what can increase the cage factor:
    - talking in a bizarre accent (a la "vampires kiss")
    - random unexplained outbursts of raw, emotional, sexual energy (like when he smokes crack in bad lieutenant port of call New Orleans)
    - any sort of bizarre behavior (like when he punches Cathy bates in the face in "wicker man")
    - general overacting in an otherwise poorly written and directed movie 
    - screaming. Screaming is a must for any high cage factor score
    - screaming and sobbing *simultaneously* receives high marks
2) Rotten tomatoes audience score
3) Rotten tomatoes critics score

Factors are listed in terms of decreasing value.  CAGE FACTOR heavily influences the odds of selection, while the critics have less of an influence.

This code was created to use Nic Cage movies to determine draft order in a fantasy football league.  This should go without saying, but it comes with no warranty and should never be used by anyone, ever, for any reason. I accept no responsibility for this demon I have created.
